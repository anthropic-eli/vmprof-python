Jit log query interface
============

This command line interface can be used to pretty print optimized
program parts by PyPy. If you are unfamiliar with the JIT compiler
built into PyPy we highly recommend reading the `docs`_ for it.

.. _`docs`: https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jit/index.html

Basic Usage
-----------

Let's go ahead and inspect the `example.py` program in this repository.
It is assumed that the reader setup vmprof for pypy already (preferably in a
virtualenv).

Now run the following command to generate the log::

    # run your program and output the log
    pypy -m vmprof -o log.jit example.py

This generates the file that normally is sent to `vmprof.com`_ whenever
`--web` is provided.

The query interface is a the flag '-q' which incooperates a small
query language. Here is an example::

    pypy -m jitlog log.jit -q 'traces()'
    ... # will print all traces generated by pypy
