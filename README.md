basic usage:

sudo apt-get install python-dev libdwarf-dev libelfg0-dev libunwind8-dev

pip install vmprof

python -m vmprof <your program> <your program args>


## vmprofshow

`vmprofshow` is a command line tool that comes with **VMprof** which can read profile files generated by **VMprof** and produce a nicely formatted output.

Here is an example of how to use:

Run a smallish program which burns CPU cycles (with vmprof enabled):

```console
pypy test/cpuburn.py
```

This will produce a profile file `vmprof_cpuburn.dat`.

Now display the profile:

```console
vmprofshow vmprof_cpuburn.dat
```

You will see a (colored) output:

```console
oberstet@thinkpad-t430s:~/scm/vmprof-python$ vmprofshow vmprof_cpuburn.dat
